# 👋 Hi, We are BijonAI team!

Bijon [/biːdʒɒn/](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc688c0f-8b8d-4087-b2e2-5824539fdbe1)(ビジョン) is the romanization of the word "Vision". We are a young AI team working hard for the development of AI technology.

## 🤖 AI

- EchoAI: AI-powered drawwable teacher for innovating education.
> I love LLM Chatbot. I love writing in Claude, brainstorming in Deepseek, and opening Android Studio's app development folder in Cursor to help build apps. I don't like chatbots generating visualizations. They either: 1. run wild and don't follow instructions (like when Midjourney draws a perfect circle); 2. lack interactivity. While chatbots can write code to generate rigorous (but extremely ugly) diagrams, these diagrams are static and non-interactive. You can't add details to a specific graphic in a static visualization - no AI tool can do this at present (I spent about two hours to verify). EchoAI is the first tool that can solve the above problems. Imagine that after you ask it to draw a circle, you can click on the shape and ask the AI ​​to change it to an ellipse, and it will do so. It will only update the code for that shape. When you ask for a specific shape, it can trace back all the historical parameters of the shape. All visualization evolution is achieved through front-end rendering. Here is a demo of our current work: https://youtu.be/rzxeIRegGTk The current workflow and fine-tuned model focus on visualizing mathematical concepts, but this technique of interacting with LLM visualizations can be directly applied to educational fields such as physics, robotics, and other non-educational fields. Our ultimate goal is to launch an end-to-end product that allows people to interact directly with LLM visualizations by just fine-tuning parameters.

> Eich is a intractive marking language for revoluting your presentation or teaching or any other you want make the data more intractive and visiual. It supports JavaScript insert, which allows you able to spread your idea and creativity. Meanwhile, eich gives a lot of graphs for example mathematical components and charts, you can easily use them with little code.
